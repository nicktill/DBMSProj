## BeSocial.java Instructions:

## Driver.java Instructions:

Before running the driver program, a few steps must be followed.

1. Run `schema2.sql`
2. `trigger2.sql`
3. In `Phase1/sample-data.sql`, run the first insertion/the admin profile insert

You will then be prompted to first enter your database username and password, if you provide the wrong information, the program will terminate. Once you establish the connection, you will be greeted by BeSocial. Login to the admin profile. From there you can create whatever accounts you want and go from there. Have fun!

### Setup:

Run in the following order:

1. Run `schema2.sql`
2. Run `trigger2.sql`
3. In `Phase1/sample-data.sql`, run the first insertion/the admin profile insert

### Execution Instructions:

Run the program. Note that you will have to enter the database username and password. If the information is wrong or a connection cannot be established, the program will terminate. The driver program will then commence to run if the proper information was given. The user will be given prompts of the following structure: `Press enter to test <TEST>`. There will be one prompt for each function of BeSocial. To commence the test, hit the 'enter' key and all of the computation will be done for you. You can take the time to scroll up in order to look at output and database status from before and after executing queries. Keep hitting enter and evaluating the test results until the program completes.

**NOTE**: If you try to do subsequent runs, make sure the database has been reset and you start at the beginning of these instructions
